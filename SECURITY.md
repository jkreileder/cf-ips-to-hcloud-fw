# Reporting Security Issues

We take security bugs in our project seriously. We appreciate your efforts to
responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

## How to Report a Security Issue

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, use the
GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/jkreileder/cf-ips-to-hcloud-fw/security/advisories/new)
tab to report the issue privately.

## What to Include

When reporting a security issue, please provide:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact and severity
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

## Response Timeline

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the
progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional
information or guidance.

We aim to:

- We strive to acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- Provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- Release a patch for confirmed vulnerabilities in a timely manner

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the latest release. Please ensure you are
running the latest version of cf-ips-to-hcloud-fw.
