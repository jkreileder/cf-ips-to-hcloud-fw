# Reporting Security Issues

We take security bugs in our project seriously. We appreciate your efforts to
responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a
Vulnerability"](https://github.com/jkreileder/cf-ips-to-hcloud-fw/security/advisories/new)
tab.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the
progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional
information or guidance.
