# cf-ips-to-hcloud-fw – Copilot Onboarding

## Quick Pitch

- CLI syncs Cloudflare IPv4/IPv6 CIDRs into Hetzner Cloud firewalls through
  official APIs.
- Python ≥3.10, src-layout package, Pydantic models; released to PyPI and Docker
  (linux/amd64 + arm64).

## Where Things Live

- `src/cf_ips_to_hcloud_fw/__main__.py` drives CLI: parse args → configure logging
  → fetch Cloudflare ranges → update firewalls.
- `cloudflare.py` wraps the Cloudflare SDK, validates with `CloudflareCIDRs`, and
  fails via `log_error_and_exit`.
- `firewall.py` edits Hetzner rules selected by `__CLOUDFLARE_IPS_*__` markers,
  then calls `client.firewalls.set_rules`; per-firewall API errors are recorded
  and the run continues, exiting non-zero at the end (see `ProjectOutcome`).
- `config.py` loads YAML into `Project` models; empty/invalid configs exit early.
- `models.py` defines Pydantic structures (`CloudflareCIDRs`, `Project`) used for
  validation and config.
- `custom_logging.py` handles logging setup and the error helpers: `log_error`
  (recoverable; logs and returns) and `log_error_and_exit` (logs then exits).
- Tests in `tests/` mirror modules with mocked SDK clients for fast runs.

## Daily Flow

- First bootstrap: `make venv` (calls `uv sync`, creates `.venv/`, installs
  default + dev groups from `uv.lock`). Later targets refresh the environment when
  the lock or `pyproject.toml` changes.
- Default loop: `make lint` (ruff + ty) → `make test` (pytest,
  coverage≥80, writes `coverage.xml` + `htmlcov/`) → `make build` (`uv build`).
  `make` runs all three.
- `make clean` wraps `git clean -xdf`; it nukes `.venv/` and every untracked
  artifact if you need a hard reset.
- Run the CLI via `.venv/bin/cf-ips-to-hcloud-fw -c config.yaml`; `-d` enables
  debug logs, `-v` prints the packaged version. Config entries provide `token` +
  `firewalls` list.

## Dependency & Packaging Rules

- Dependencies live in `pyproject.toml`; `uv.lock` captures the resolved set. Use
  `make upgrade-deps` (aka `uv lock --upgrade`) for dependency bumps.
- Expect churn in generated artifacts: `uv.lock`, `dist/`, coverage outputs.
  Commit only when intentionally rebuilt.
- Docker builder runs via `uv` (sync, lint, test, build) and the final image
  installs using the lock file.

## CI & Quality Gates

- `python-package.yaml` runs the uv sync / lint (ruff, ty) / test /
  build steps directly on CPython 3.10–3.14, uploads coverage, SBOM, and
  attestations.
- `docker.yaml` performs multi-arch builds, security scans (Docker Scout + Grype),
  signing, and SLSA provenance.
- Additional workflows cover CodeQL, dependency review, scorecard, and pytest
  result publication.

### Additional repo maintenance tools

- `.dockerignore` — present at the repository root and used by the `docker.yaml`
  workflow; it intentionally keeps the Docker build context small by whitelisting
  only project files needed for the container (the `src` package, `tests`,
  `LICENSE`, `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, and `uv.lock`). See `.dockerignore`
  if you get container build surprises.
- `pre-commit` — a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file is present and configured to
  run utilities like `ruff`, `gitleaks`, and `markdownlint-cli2`. New
  contributors should install hooks with `pre-commit install` or
  `prek install`.
- Commit sign-offs — PRs require developer sign-off using `git commit -s`;
  you can see the PR checklist in `.github/pull_request_template.md`. This is
  the project DCO requirement. GitHub also enforces cryptographically-signed
  commits for this repository via branch protection — you must configure
  GPG/SSH commit signing locally or use the `-S` flag to sign commits if
  required. Note that package and image artifacts are also cryptographically
  signed during CI.
- Commit style — commit messages should follow Conventional Commits
  (`<type>[optional scope]: <description>`), e.g., `fix(auth): resolve login
  issue`.
- Please also format PR titles using Conventional Commits (`<type>[optional
  scope]: <description>`), for example `chore(deps): bump ruff to v0.14.6`.

## Gotchas

- Python 3.14 emits a benign Pydantic V1 warning; CI accepts it.
- Make recipes run under `bash -eu -o pipefail`; avoid zshisms.

- Missing wheels or odd installs? Remove `.venv/` (or `make clean`) then
  rerun `make venv`.
- Preserve the `__CLOUDFLARE_IPS_*__` description tokens; firewall matching
  logic depends on them.
- When editing `README.md`, update the table of contents if you add, remove,
  or rename sections. The TOC is manually maintained and marked with
  `<!-- omit in toc -->` for the title.

- Markdown style: When creating or editing Markdown files, aim for a
  maximum line width of 100 characters and wrap prose at sentence boundaries
  where practical. Do not reflow code blocks, tables, YAML snippets, or long
  URLs — those can exceed the limit. This keeps diffs readable and aligns with
  the repository's Markdown editor settings (`.vscode/settings.json`).
